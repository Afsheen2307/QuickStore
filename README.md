# QuickStore
QuickStore!!! This is a sleek web app where we can save and organize all our Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts links in one place.
Features:

 Add Links: Paste any Reel or Short URL with an optional title
 Search: Quickly find saved links by title or URL
 Filter: Sort by platform (Instagram, YouTube, or All)
 Copy: One-click copy to clipboard
 Delete: Remove links you no longer need
 Auto-save: All your links are saved automatically and persist across sessions
 Auto-detect: Automatically identifies Instagram and YouTube links

The app uses persistent storage, so your links will be saved even when you close and reopen the app. Each link shows when it was added and has color-coded badges for easy platform identification.
Just paste your links, give them memorable titles, and access them anytime!


This QuickStore webapp is built using:

1.React (JavaScript library)

For building the interactive user interface
Managing state and component logic
Handling user interactions

2.JavaScript (ES6+)

Core programming language
Async/await for storage operations
Array methods for filtering and sorting


3.Tailwind CSS

For styling and design
Responsive layout
Gradient backgrounds, shadows, and animations


4.HTML (JSX syntax)

Structure of the web page
Rendered through React components


5.Lucide React

Icon library for visual elements (Instagram, YouTube, Search, Trash icons, etc.)



In summary: It's primarily a React + JavaScript application styled with Tailwind CSS. React handles all the functionality (adding, deleting, searching links), while Tailwind makes it look beautiful and responsive.
The app also uses the browser's storage API (provided by the Claude artifacts environment) to save your links permanently.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
